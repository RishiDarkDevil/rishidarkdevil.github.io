      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came across this interesting problem on which my seniors were brainstorming late at night. It requires a bit knowledge of continuous random variables in probability and little bit visualization capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem goes like this… &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;There are three musketeers who stand on a circle randomly, which follows Uniform(0, 2πr) independently where r is the radius of the circle. They can help each other if they are close enough in case of a sudden attack by the enemies. Find the probability of them lying on the same semicircle.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have this friend of mine, who constantly pokes me to solve interesting puzzles. He sometimes even rings me up, just to look at the problem he sent :P This is one of those problems, that I enjoyed working on. It requires understanding of basic probability theory, counting and some time to stick to a problem that interests you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem goes like this… &lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;There are 7 stones in a row labelled 1 to 7 from left to right. A rabbit starts at stone 1 and on each turn hops to a new stone that they haven’t visited yet. After visiting all the stones, what is the probability the rabbit made exactly one leftwards jump?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
