It involved doing some research work, implementing some research paper in the domain of Quantum Computing. This is my final project.\nAbstract The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is utilizes current limited quantum devices effectively and they requires a quantum circuit with parameters, called a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), to prepare a quantum state, and the quantum state is used to calculate the expectation value of a given Hamiltonian. Here, I implement one such problem specific PQC to solve the travelling salesman problem which is discussed in the paper by Matsuo, A., Suzuki, Y., \u0026amp; Yamashita, S. Problem-specific parameterized quantum circuits of the VQE algorithm for optimization problems. 2020.\nTable of Contents Formulating the Traveling Salesman Problem create a graph to represent our configuration convert the problem into a QUBO and obtain the equivalent Ising Hamiltonian Implementing a Problem Specific Parameterized Quantum Circuit for TSP construct a 3-qubit W-State with two parameters construct a Sampler routine build up a TSP entangler routine for a general case build up a VQE routine for the TSP entangler build up a Sampler routine with the optimal circuit and the list of parameter values build up a circuit to accomodate all the constraints find a TSP solution for a 4 node graph problem Conclusion Bibliography Reflection Questions Formulating the Traveling Salesman Problem This problem derives its importance from its “hardness” and ubiquitous equivalence to other relevant combinatorial optimization problems that arise in practice.\nThe mathematical formulation with some early analysis was proposed by W.R. Hamilton in the early 19th century. Mathematically the problem is, as in the case of Max-Cut [1], best abstracted in terms of graphs. The TSP on the nodes of a graph asks for the shortest Hamiltonian cycle that can be taken through each of the nodes. A Hamilton cycle is a closed path that uses every vertex of a graph once. The general solution is unknown and an algorithm that finds it efficiently (e.g., in polynomial time) is not expected to exist.\nFind the shortest Hamiltonian cycle in a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n=|V|$ nodes and distances, $w_{ij}$ (distance from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$). A Hamiltonian cycle is described by $N^2$ variables $x_{i,p}$, where $i$ represents the node and $p$ represents its order in a prospective cycle. The decision variable takes the value 1 if the solution occurs at node $i$ at time order $p$. We require that every node can only appear once in the cycle, and for each time a node has to occur. This amounts to the two constraints (here and in the following, whenever not specified, the summands run over 0,1,…N-1)\n$$ \\begin{equation}\\tag{1} \\sum_{i} x_{i,p} = 1 ~~\\forall p. \\end{equation} $$ $$ \\begin{equation}\\tag{2} \\sum_{p} x_{i,p} = 1 ~~\\forall i. \\end{equation} $$\n$p$ is the (discrete) time (mentioned as order here) when the $i^{th}$ node occurs. It is denoted by $x_{i,p}$.\nFor nodes in our prospective ordering, if $x_{i,p}$ and $x_{j,p+1}$ are both 1, then there should be an energy penalty if $(i,j) \\notin E$ (not connected in the graph). The form of this penalty is\n$$\\sum_{i,j\\notin E}\\sum_{p} x_{i,p}x_{j,p+1}\u0026gt;0,$$\nwhere it is assumed the boundary condition of the Hamiltonian cycles $(p=N)\\equiv (p=0)$. However, here it will be assumed a fully connected graph and not include this term. The distance that needs to be minimized is\n$$B(\\textbf{x})=\\sum_{i,j}w_{ij}\\sum_{p} x_{i,p}x_{j,p+1}$$\nPutting this all together in a single objective function to be minimized, we get the following:\n$$C(\\textbf{x})=B(\\textbf{x})+ A\\sum_p\\left(1- \\sum_i x_{i,p}\\right)^2 +A\\sum_i\\left(1- \\sum_p x_{i,p}\\right)^2,$$\nwhere $A$ is a free parameter. One needs to ensure that $A$ is large enough so that these constraints are respected. One way to do this is to choose $A$ such that $A \u0026gt; \\mathrm{max}(w_{ij})$.\nOnce again, it is easy to map the problem in this form to a quantum computer, and the solution will be found by minimizing an Ising Hamiltonian.
